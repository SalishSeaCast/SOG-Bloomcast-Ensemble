SoG-bloomcast is a an operational oceanography project to provide daily updated forecasts of the first spring phytoplankton bloom in the Strait of Georgia on the British Columbia south coast.
In addition to being part of an active research program on the physics and biogeochemistry of the Salish Sea,
SoG-bloomcast is intended as a demonstration of how small university research groups can use lightweight software automation to publish near-real-time model results to the web.

SoG-bloomcast uses the SOG coupled physics-biogeochemical model for deep estuaries
(http://www.eos.ubc.ca/~sallen/SOG-docs/)
to do its science,
and publishes its results to the web at http://eos.ubc.ca/~sallen/SoG-bloomcast/results.html.

SoG-bloomcast is written in Python.
